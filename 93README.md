I've completed this project solo since my partner dropped
out of school mid-way through the semester. I've already
e-mailed regarding this situation, and I was told I only
had to do section 1 (auctions). I felt this was unfair,
since we completed all of the preliminary assignments. All
the code is mine.

Special Uses of Technology:
	- Cookie-based Session Authentication
	- Role Based Access Control
	- Cloud Storage for uploading images

Bonus:
	- I've implemented the bonus feature of allowing a user
	  to create a custom category and allow all normal actions
	  of categories (searching, alerts, etc.) to remain in tact.
